Things I learned or practiced in this project:

- Got more practice in using react-router-dom and making multi-page websites.
- Got more practice in using useParams hook. Used it to make API calls using the query parameter in my call.
- Used Axios to make my API calls instead of the traditional FETCH keyword to make my calls.
- Learned about DOMPurify and why it is used. Used it to purify some HTML data that I was getting from the call.
- Learned about the method toLocaleString() which puts commas in numbers to make them more readable which is very useful.
